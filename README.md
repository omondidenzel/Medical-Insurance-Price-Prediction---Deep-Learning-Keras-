## Introduction
This project is to build an Deep Learning model thats able to predict Medical Insurance cover price. Insurance cover has been has become important and therefore it is by all mean important based on some feature the predict the prices of the cover. 

## Technologies
This project is built using 

*Python 3.*+ - Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
*Kera, Tensorflow

## Setup 
For this project to run successfully ensure python and and pyspark is intalled
```
    To install python - brew install python for mac users
    To install pyspark - pip3 install pyspark/pip install pyspark
```

## Evaluation
Evaluation Metrics
The model performance will be based on Rooot Mean Squared Error (RMSE), a commonly used metric for regression problems.
